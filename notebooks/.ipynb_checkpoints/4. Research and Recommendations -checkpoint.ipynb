    "\n",
    "**Direct Measures:** \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>1. If possible, **make the SAT a mandatory** high school graudation requirement. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>2. Establish a contractual agreement with schools in Oregon to **fund the SATs**. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>3. Expand SAT sites and include an **SAT School Day**. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>4. **Require participation in free PSAT and enrollment in free SAT prep course**. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>5. **Steakholder Outreach** - every students' parent should be notified and informed via brochures or school organized teacher-parent conferences on the importance their children's college preparedness. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>6.**Marketing Strategy** - College Board Representatives and events on campus to increase student awareness in an environemnt where peer pressure is high - students are more likely to sign up if they see their friends signing up in a social setting. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/> **Indirect Measures:**\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>1. Capmus-cultural, narrative and expectation changes - hire staff across school campus or retrain existing staff to integrate college preparedness activities into classwork on a regular basis, and reform the school narrative to set college preparedness as an expectation that every student must meet rather than an optional choice easily accessible only to those interested. \n",

    "# 3. Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the recommendations to improve SAT participation rates is campus-cultural, narrative and expectation changes. It is important to note that these are not as much changes, as they are reforms because they will require significant investment in reshaping social structures in place between students, counselors and educators. However, combined with the recommendation to require participation in PSAT and SAT preparation course, this strategy will not only increase participation rates, but will help the participants actually be better prepared to take the SAT and to face college post-graduation. While our immediate goal is to increase participation, it is important to note that as participation incrases, generally the average SAT scores drop. Therefore, while preparation for the SAT's is a secondary goal at the moment, the recomendations proposed here will help College Board ensure that schools are taking the first steps towards not only increased participation, but also better quality of college and career preparedness for their graduates.
