# College Board Initiatives to Increase SAT Participation

The objective of this report is to identify where College Board may best invest its funding and support to help schools across all states increase their SAT participation rates. This report is based on analyses of data SAT and ACT participation rates in 2017 and 2018. Links to the data are provided in the notebooks.

### Summary of Results

Oregon was identified as the state in most need of immediate College Board support as standardized test participation in oregon, including both SAT and ACT is well below the national average. The state's participation is below 50% in both tests for two consecutive years - 2017 and 2018. According to research, there are a variety of pressing issues that are contributing to Oregon's low participation rates, one of them indicating that the state is not only falling behind in college preparedness programs, but also in basic high school graduation requirements. Each one of these factors is discussed in Notebook 4. A list of recommendations on how to tackle the issues Oregon faces is proposed which, if implemented, can help not only increase SAT participation rates but also put the schools on track to start thinking about how to improve the quality of their students preparedness in higher education overall.
